# SF-seq_QAA

This assignment is due Wednesday, Oct 4 by 11:59 PM.

Be sure to upload all relevant materials by the deadline and **double check** to be sure that your off-line repository is up-to-date with your on-line repository. Answers to the questions can be submitted as ```html```, Github markdown, or ```pdf```.


Answers are in files beginning with "ho_sf-seq" with different extensions. 

Basic UNIX commands are shown in "ho_sf-seq" but python scripts and slurm scripts are in the "scripts/" folder.

Outputs from scripts and commands are organized in folders by the corresponding "Parts" of the assignment.

r code is supressed in rendered .html & .pdf files but can be viewed in .Rmd

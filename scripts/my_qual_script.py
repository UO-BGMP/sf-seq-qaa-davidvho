## Takes in multiple FASTQ files and returns metrics for the quality score at each bp position. Output is a tab-delim .txt file per FASTQ input

## IMPORTS

import numpy as np
import argparse
import zipfile
import gzip

## BACKGROUND DEFINITIONS

## Definte a function that gets a quality score
def convert_phred(letter):                                   
    """Converts a single ASCII character into a quality score, assuming Phred+33"""
    qscore = ord(letter) - 33   # ord takes the ASCII char and turns it into a Phred score 
    return qscore

## Arg parsing
def qual_score():
	parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Fastq files past through will output a .txt file with metrics for the quality score at each bp position')
	parser.add_argument("-f", help="FASTQ file", required=True, type=str, nargs='*')
